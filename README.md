# Iron Amulet
In-progress port of Amulet Editor to Rust.

Note that Amulet Editor places some restriction on how its code may be used,
e.g. to compete with Amulet Editor, or for commercial purposes.
While no code here is copied from Amulet Editor, it still draws heavily from the Amulet Editor
codebase.
Out of an abundance of caution, you should consult Amulet Editor's respositories and license files
for more information if your usage of this program or code might conflict with their license.
