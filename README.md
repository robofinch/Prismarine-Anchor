# Iron Amulet
In-progress port of [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/) to Rust.

### Licensing

This project itself is dually licensed under two open source licenses (you may use this project
and its code with which one you prefer), which places few limitations on how you use,
share, copy, or modify it, and so on. Additionally, many of its dependencies
and sources of inspiration or code (e.g. the awesome `quartz_nbt` and `rusty-leveldb`'s MCPE example)
are open source.

A notable exception is that Amulet Editor does place some substantial restrictions
on its usage and modification, which this project's licenses cannot and do not remove.
The [Amulet Team License 1.0.0](https://github.com/Amulet-Team/Amulet-NBT/blob/4.0/LICENSE)
prohibits, for instance, commercially competing with Amulet Editor for a non-educational purpose.

While no code here is copied from Amulet Editor (though it does read PyMCTranslate's provided JSON),
it still draws heavily from the Amulet Editor codebase; the code and noncommercial app here
is a permissible use, but if you intend to make a commercial product or service
with modified or copied parts of Amulet Editor or Iron Amulet, it's likely not permitted if
it competes with something that the Amulet Team provides.
There are parts of this codebase which should have wholly open source origins and status,
but it's simpler to avoid toeing the line.
